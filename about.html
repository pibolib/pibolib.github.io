				Hello!
				<br>
				<br>
				I'm a solo game developer from the Eastern United States.
				<br>
				<br>
				I was born on October 17, 2003, which makes me 16 years old. I've been developing games in GameMaker for about 2 years, and I've recently switched to Godot Engine. I tend to develop games on my own because of a personal goal of complete consistency between game elements (i.e. Music, Art, and Gameplay.) Only a small fraction of games on this website have been developed with another person.
				<br>
				<br>
				Outside of game development, I've been learning python for making tools and other software, and this website is one of my first experiments in the HTML/CSS/JS sphere.
				<br>
				<br>
				I'm an avid fan of puzzle games, rhythm games, rpgs, and various other genres of games, and elements of those games end up finding their way into my own. 
				<br>
				<br>
				I've been learning Japanese for almost a year now, so you might see a small bit of Japanese influence here and there, whether in my games or in parts of other things. (Kinda a weeb, just a little.)
				This website will probably get a Japanese version, in the distant future.

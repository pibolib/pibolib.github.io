				Hello!
				<br>
				<br>
				I'm a solo game developer from the Eastern United States.
				<br>
				<br>
				I was born on October 17, 2003, which makes me 16 years old. I've been developing games in GameMaker for about 2 years, and I've recently switched to Godot Engine. I tend to develop games on my own because of a personal goal of complete consistency between game elements (i.e. Music, Art, and Gameplay.) Only a small fraction of games on this website have been developed with another person.
				<br>
				<br>
				I'm working hard now to get my skills together so that one day, I could possibly get a game on Steam. At the current moment, Cubika is my largest and most ambitious project to date, and I hope to give it that honor.
				<br>
				<br>
				Outside of game development, I've been learning python for making tools and other software, and this website is one of my first experiments in the HTML/CSS/JS sphere.
				<br>
				<br>
				I'm an avid fan of puzzle games, rhythm games, rpgs, and various other genres of games, and elements of those games end up finding their way into my own. 
				<br>
				<br>
				I've been learning Japanese for almost a year now, so you might see a small bit of Japanese influence here and there, whether in my games or in parts of other things. (Kinda a weeb, just a little.)
				This website will probably get a Japanese version, in the distant future.
				<br>
				<br>
				Note: I've had issues talking with people online for the longest time, and it's more of a personal thing so I won't elaborate too much, but if you contact me and I don't respond right away, please do not be offended.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Site Information
			</h2>
			<p style="padding-left:5%;padding-right:5%">
				This site isn't anything special, I'm not even running it off of a server I own. It's GitHub pages down to the core. Perhaps, at some point in the future, I'll get my hands on actual hardware to host a server off of.
				<br>
				<br>
				The styling on this website is built on top of W3.CSS.

					At its most basic level, Cubika is a game about making squares. 
					You can make squares to get a high score, defeat enemies, clear objectives, and much more.
					<br>
					<br>
					There are many modes for you to play through, each with its own goals and gameplay differences.
					<br>
				</p>
				<ul style="padding-left:10%;padding-right:10%;text-align:left">
					<li>
						Aim for a high score in <b>ENDLESS</b> mode.
					</li>
					<li>
						Clear set boards in <b>PUZZLE</b> mode.
					</li>
					<li>
						Fight against enemies and explore a labyrinth in <b>DUNGEON</b> mode.
					</li>
					<li>
						Fight against other players (locally) in <b>BATTLE</b> mode.
					</li>
					<li>
						Try to get the highest score in 3 minutes in <b>SCORE ATTACK</b> mode.

						You start with a board filled with pieces. Your goal is to maximize the amount of points you can receive from clearing them.
						If you make a square out of the pieces of the same color by moving them together, you can trigger the square to clear it.
						<br>
						<br>
						If you clear many squares in a row without moving pieces, a combo will start, increasing the amount of points you get per square.
						Also, you can make larger squares that give a larger base. Aim for a combination of both to maximize your score.
						<br>
						<br>
						If you clear all pieces of a certain color, or all pieces in general, you will be rewarded with many more points.

						Every few seconds, a new row of pieces will fall from the sky. If you attempt to clear something that cannot be cleared, a new row of pieces might be forced upon you.
						As you keep playing, pieces will come faster and faster. If a piece cannot land on the 10x10 grid, then it's game over.
						<br>
						<br>
						Keep your board clean and keep your combos and clears large, and a high score will soon be yours.

					Alas, you cannot get the game yet. A demo is planned for release in the near future, but there is much more that I plan on adding to the game before it's final release. The demo will have a sizeable chunk of content, but the game will be in development for a <b>much</b> longer time, and its final release will be a paid game.
					<br>
					<br>
					For the time being, you can follow the development of the game on my <a href="https://twitter.com/pibolib">Twitter</a> page.

				In late 2019, after a little bit of peer pressure, some random decisionmaking and some weebish justification, I decided to pick up <a href="https://www.duolingo.com" target="_blank">Duolingo</a> to learn Japanese.

				I think the stats speak for themselves.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="indent">
				I've been picking up a lot of grammatical bits and fundamentals from Duolingo, but vocabulary appears to be my weakness at the current moment, so I find myself referencing the <a href="https://jisho.org/" target="_blank">Jisho</a> online dictionary a lot. 
			</p>

				I haven't used any of my Japanese knowledge in a conversation with anyone yet, but that's more of a personal thing that I've yet to overcome. I know that having conversations with people who speak a language natively is important to learning a language effectively, but I haven't built up the confidence to talk to anyone quite yet. I certainly have the intake part down though, I've followed 50 billion Japanese people on Twitter and watch Japanese YouTube videos all of the time, heck, I even play some games in Japanese just to make things more difficult for myself. 
			</p>

				As of late, I have started taking classes with a tutor every week. My hopes are to overcome my inability to speak to people, along with becoming more competent in the Japanese language.

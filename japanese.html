				In late 2019, after a little bit of peer pressure, some random decisionmaking and some weebish justification, I decided to pick up <a href="https://www.duolingo.com" target="_blank">Duolingo</a> to learn Japanese.

				I think the stats speak for themselves.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="indent">
				I've been picking up a lot of grammatical bits and fundamentals from Duolingo, but vocabulary appears to be my weakness at the current moment, so I find myself referencing the <a href="https://jisho.org/" target="_blank">Jisho</a> online dictionary a lot. 
			</p>
			<br>

				I haven't used any of my Japanese knowledge in a conversation with anyone yet, but that's more of a personal thing that I've yet to overcome. I know that having conversations with people who speak a language natively is important to learning a language effectively, but I haven't built up the confidence to talk to anyone quite yet. I certainly have the intake part down though, I've followed 50 billion Japanese people on Twitter and watch Japanese YouTube videos all of the time, heck, I even play some games in Japanese just to make things more difficult for myself. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="indent">
				Learning Japanese has become something more than just a weebish interest to me since I started learning it. I have plans to visit Japan at some point in the future, and I sure would like to be able to communicate effectively and not force people to speak my language. Also, learning Japanese factors into my research in game history, as so much of game history is found in Japan. I love finding obscure circles and trying to find out where they went or what they're doing now.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="indent">
				In the future, I hope to build games with localization in mind so that I can possibly translate them into Japanese, but it will take a while before I can reach that level.
